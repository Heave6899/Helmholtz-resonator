#### Procedure
<pre>
1. Using digital callipers the neck length and inner diameter of the neck are determined and the actual neck volume is calculated.

Neck length (L) = 3.5cm = 3.5x10-2m Inner diameter of the neck = 2.4cm Inner radius of the
neck (r) = 1.2cm Neck area (A) = ∏r 2 = 4.52cm2= 0.452X10-3 m2 Neck volume = πr2L
=1.583x10-5m3

2. Room temperature (T) is noted from the digital thermometer T =27.4°C
3. Velocity of sound (c) is calculated at room temperature.
c = 331+0.607x27.4 =347.7 m/s
4. The separating funnel is now placed on the circular clamp fitted to a retort stand. The speaker–microphone system is now placed above the neck and microphone is positioned at the centre of the neck opening.
5. The speaker is connected to the sine wave output of the function generator and its amplitude is set to its maximum value and frequency is set to X100Hz band.
6. The microphone is connected to the digital storage oscilloscope (DSO).
7. The function generator is switched on and sound is heard in the speaker.
8. Water is filled up to the brim of the separating funnel. Hence, the volume of the resonator is zero.
9. Now a fixed quantity of water is drained out through the funnel using a graduated beaker which creates
some space in the separating funnel or the resonator volume now becomes equal to the volume of water drained out. Hence resonator volume, V, is given by V = initial volume.

The frequency of the function generator is increased from 100Hz hearing sound and watching the DSO. At the resonance frequency the sound will have the maximum amplitude and the DSO shows the maximum amplitude. This is the resonance point. The resonance frequency is noted from the DSO
10. Trial is repeated by draining out some quantity of water; making the volume of the resonator cavity equal to that volume and the resonance frequency for this volume is determined and recorded in Table.
11. The trial is repeated until all the water is drained out and the resonance frequency of empty funnel is determined.
12. A graph is plotted taking 1/V along X-axis and f along Y-axis which gives a straight line. It is seen that the theoretical curve passes through the origin, whereas the experimental curve does not pass through the origin. The slopes of two straight lines are determined as [(mthet.) / (mexpt)] ^2
13. For empty resonator the observed resonance frequency is 276 Hz which corresponds to
√1/V =58
This is the volume of the resonator which can be verified by filling the separating funnel with water completely, and its exact volume is determined.
