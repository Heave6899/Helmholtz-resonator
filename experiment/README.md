### Aim
To Illustrate the relationship of the resonant frequency with cavity volume of a Helmholtz resonator.
### Theory
Helmholtz Resonator is also called as Wind Throb. The original resonator was made up of Brass and spherical in shape and one can blow air from the cavity at the top of the resonator. The main aim of the resonator is to tune the base frequency with associated frequency to depress or to raise the sound. Helmholtz Resonator is frequently used as a musical instrument. The formula to find the natural and resonating frequency is...
				      f=(c/2π) √(A/VL)
### Procedure
1.Click on Neck , Area opening port and Volume of the cavity respectively.

5. Now open the observation table and click on the ADD OBSERVATION. Then repeat step 3. And 5. 
    Alternately to take at least 14 observations.
