#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>Expository</u>
###### Assessment Method: Formative and summative

<u> <b>Description: </b> </u>
<br><justify>
 Helmholtz resonator is a vessel with a narrow neck. Neck dimensions like length, area, diameter and volume are determined. The speaker-microphone system is placed above the neck. The speaker is connected to the sine wave output of the function generator and a particular value of the frequency is set. The microphone is connected to the DSO. Speakers are switched on and sound is heard. Water is filled up to the brim of the separating funnel. Now 25 ml water is drained out through the funnel using a graduated beaker which creates 25 ml space in the separating funnel, so the resonator volume becomes 25 ml. the frequency of the function generator is increased from 100Hz hearing sound and watching the DSO. At the resonance frequency the sound will have the maximum amplitude and the DSO shows maximum amplitude. The resonance frequency is noted from the DSO. Theoretical frequency is also calculated using the given equation. Trial is repeated by draining out 25 ml water; making the volume of the resonator cavity to 50 ml and the resonance frequency is determined and recorded in table. The trial is repeated until all the water is drained out and the resonance frequency of empty funnel is determined (theoretical and experimental). A graph is plotted taking 1/V along X-axis and f along Y axis which gives a straight line. It is seen that the theoretical curve passes through the origin 0, whereas the experimental curve does not pass through the origin. The slopes of the two curves are determined and the value of corrected neck length is obtained by putting their values in the formula. For empty resonator a certain value of resonance frequency is obtained which corresponds to a certain volume. This volume experimental as well as actual is noted in the conclusion table along with corrected neck length.
