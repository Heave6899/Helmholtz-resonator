#### 3. Instructional Strategy
###### Name of Instructional Strategy  :    <u>Expository</u>
###### Assessment Method: Formative

<u> <b>Description: </b> </u>
<br><justify>
 Helmholtz resonator is a flask with a narrow neck. Neck dimensions like length, area, diameter and volume are determined. The speaker-microphone system is placed above the neck. The speaker is connected to the sine wave output of the function generator and frequency 185 Hz is set. The microphone is connected to the DSO. Speakers are switched on and sound is heard. Now 20 ml water is drained out through the funnel and stored in a graduated beaker. The frequency of the function generator is increased from 185 Hz hearing sound and watching the DSO. At the resonance frequency, the sound will have the maximum amplitude and a light will be turned on to confirm the same. The resonance frequency is noted from the DSO. Theoretical frequency is also calculated using the given equation. Trial is repeated by draining out 20 ml water, making the volume of the resonator cavity to 20 ml and so on and the resonance frequency is determined and recorded in table. The trial is repeated until all the water is drained out and the resonance frequency of empty flask is determined (theoretical and experimental). Corrected length is determined by prompting a formula to the user. A graph is plotted taking 1/√V along X-axis and f along Y-axis which gives a straight line. It is seen that the theoretical curve passes through the origin, whereas the experimental curve does not pass through the origin. The slopes of the two curves are determined and the value of corrected neck length is obtained by putting their values in the formula.
